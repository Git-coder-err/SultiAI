            <p>
              Cebuano (Bisaya) is one of the most widely spoken languages in the Philippines — yet
              language-learning tools for it remain scarce. We saw a gap: learners had Duolingo for
              Spanish and French, but nothing built specifically for the languages of the Visayas.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we built SultiAI. It combines an adaptive AI tutor, speech-driven practice, and a
              community of native speakers into one experience — designed from the ground up for
              Bisaya and the culture that surrounds it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along the way we realized the app could do more than teach. It could help preserve the
              language itself — through the Living Lexicon, dialectal variations, and native-speaker
              verification. Every learner becomes a participant in that mission.
